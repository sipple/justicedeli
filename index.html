<p>For decades, Carl Cook fought crime in the city of New Caliburn as the
superhero Piecemaker. He never made the front ranks of The
Heralds, New Caliburn's elite superhero team, but he carved out a place for himself and his sidekick
Crashtest AKA Tommy Pigeon. Carl eventually realized the toll heroing
had taken on his life, leading to his divorce and alienating his
daughter Tabitha (who is secretly following in his footsteps as the
Pixel). In an attempt to move on and take charge of his life, Carl hung
up the cape and opened Cook's Deli.</p>

<p>By exploring the city of New Caliburn and the world around Cook's Deli,
the short story anthology THE DELI COUNTER OF JUSTICE shows the impact
Carl had as a superhero and continues to have outside of the costume.</p>
